        <strong><i>Iceland</i></strong>, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape
        with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers
        are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of
        the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal
        power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s
        Viking history.
