        Germany , officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[e] is a country in
        Central Europe. It is the second most populous country in Europe after
        Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union.
        Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and
        the Alps to the south; it covers an area of 357,022 square kilometres
        (137,847 sq mi), with a population of over 83 million within its 16
        constituent states. Germany borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the
        Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and
        France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The
        nation's capital and largest city is Berlin, and its financial centre is
        Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.
        <br />
        <br />
        Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern
        Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was
        documented before AD 100. In the 10th century, German territories formed
        a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century,
        northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation.
        Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman
        Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. In 1871,
        Germany became a nation-state when most of the German states unified
        into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the
        German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the
        semi-presidential Weimar Republic.

        Argentina , officially the Argentine Republic[A] (Spanish: República
        Argentina), is a country in the southern half of South America.
        Argentina covers an area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] making
        it the largest Spanish-speaking nation in the world by area. It is the
        second-largest country in South America after Brazil, the fourth-largest
        country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. It
        shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, and is also
        bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast,
        Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage
        to the . <br /><br />
        Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and
        one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of
        the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own
        constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims
        sovereignty over a part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and South
        Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The earliest recorded human
        presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic
        period.[16] The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in
        Pre-Columbian times. <br />
        <br />
        The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during
        the 16th century.[17] Argentina rose as the successor state of the
        Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata,[18] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty
        founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818)
        was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861,
        culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation. The country
        thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of
        European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards, radically reshaping
        its cultural and demographic outlook; over 60% of the population has
        full or partial Italian ancestry,[19][20][21] and Argentine culture has
        significant connections to Italian culture.[22]

        country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and several
        islands surrounding it,[note 1] whose territory largely coincides with
        the homonymous geographical region.[17] Italy is located in the middle
        of the Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe;[18][19][20] it is also
        considered part of Western Europe.[21][note 2] A unitary parliamentary
        republic with Rome as its capital and largest city, the country covers a
        total area of 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi) and shares land borders with
        France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, as well as the enclaved
        microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a territorial
        exclave in Switzerland, Campione. With over 60 million inhabitants,[22]
        Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union.
        <br />
        <br />Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the
        Mediterranean, Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and
        cultures. In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed
        throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the
        Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning
        from the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies
        mostly in insular Italy,[23] Greeks established settlements in the
        so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy, while Etruscans and Celts
        inhabited central and northern Italy respectively. An Italic tribe known
        as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which
        eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the
        People.

        Bangladesh , officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a
        country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the
        world, with a population exceeding 163 million people in an area of
        either 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi) or 147,570 square
        kilometres (56,980 sq mi),[7][15] making it one of the most densely
        populated countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with
        India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the
        south it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal.
        <br /><br />
        It is narrowly separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor;
        and from China by 100 km of the Indian state of Sikkim in the north.[16]
        Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic,
        political, and cultural hub. Chittagong, the largest seaport, is the
        second-largest city. The official language is Bengali, one of the
        eastern-most branches of the Indo-European language family. Bangladesh
        forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of
        Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in
        1947.[17] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was
        an important cultural center in the Indian subcontinent as the home of
        the states of Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela.
        The Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra and Deva dynasties were the last
        pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal. The Muslim conquest of Bengal began in
        1204 when Bakhtiar Khalji overran northern Bengal and invaded Tibet.
        Becoming part of the Delhi Sultanate, three city-states emerged in the
        14th century with much of eastern Bengal being ruled from Sonargaon.

        France , officially the French Republic (French: République
        française[14]), is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe
        and overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic,
        Pacific and Indian Oceans.[XIII] Its metropolitan area extends from the
        Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the
        English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French
        Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North
        Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the
        Indian Ocean. <br /><br />
        Due to its several coastal territories, France has the largest exclusive
        economic zone in the world. France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany,
        Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Andorra, and Spain in Europe, as well as the
        Netherlands, Suriname, and Brazil in the Americas via its overseas
        territories in French Guiana and Saint Martin. Its eighteen integral
        regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2
        (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of May 2021).[5] France
        is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the
        country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other
        major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux,
        and Nice. Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of
        Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during
        the Iron Age. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct
        Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language.
        <br /><br />
        The Germanic Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the
        heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843
        partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France
        in 987. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly
        decentralised feudal kingdom.

        Belgium,[A] officially the Kingdom of Belgium,[B] is a country in
        Northwestern Europe. The country is bordered by the Netherlands to the
        north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast, France to the
        southwest, and the North Sea to the northwest. It covers an area of
        30,689 km2 (11,849 sq mi) and has a population of more than 11.5
        million, making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world
        and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe, with a density of
        376 per square kilometre (970/sq mi). The capital and largest city is
        Brussels; other major cities are Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi, Liège,
        Bruges, Namur, and Leuven. Belgium is a sovereign state and a federal
        constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. Its institutional
        organization is complex and is structured on both regional and
        linguistic grounds. <br /><br />
        It is divided into three highly autonomous regions:[11] the Flemish
        Region (Flanders) in the north, the Walloon Region (Wallonia) in the
        south, and the Brussels-Capital Region.[12] Brussels is the smallest and
        most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of
        GDP per capita. Belgium is home to two main linguistic communities: the
        Dutch-speaking Flemish Community, which constitutes about 60 percent of
        the population, and the French-speaking Community, which constitutes
        about 40 percent of the population. A small German-speaking Community,
        numbering around one percent, exists in the East Cantons.<br /><br />
        The country as it exists today was established following the 1830
        Belgian Revolution, when it seceded from the Netherlands, which had
        itself only existed since 1815. The name chosen for the new state is
        derived from the Latin word Belgium, used in Julius Caesar's "Gallic
        Wars", to describe a nearby region in the period around 55 BCE.[15]
        Belgium is part of an area known as the Low Countries, historically a
        somewhat larger region than the Benelux group of states, as it also
        included parts of northern France.
