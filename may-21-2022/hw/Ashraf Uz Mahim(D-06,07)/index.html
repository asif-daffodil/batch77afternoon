          >Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of
        </strong>
        substances including gases, particles, and biological molecules are
        intoduced into Earth's atmosphere. It may cause diseases, allergles and
        even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms
        such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built
        environment. Both human activity and natural processes can generate air
        pollution.

        Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the
        world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith institute
        World's Worst Polluted Places report. According to the 2014 World Health
        Organization report, air pollution in 2010 caused the deaths of around 7
        million people worldwide, an estimate roughly echoed by one from the
        International Energy Agency.

      <p class="iam_paptagthree sizekoto">
        Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of
        pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart
        disesse, COPD, stroke and lung cancer, Growing evidence suggests that
        air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores,
        impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as
        depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of
        poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's
        respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions
        to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to
        , the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and
        genetics. Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths
        annually, makeing it one of the top contributors to human death.
        Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people
        worldwide each year, and is the world's largest single environmental
        health risk. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed
        as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008
        Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of
        the air pollution cirsis is enormous: 90% of the world's population
        breathes dirty air to some degree. Although the health consequences are
        extensive, the way the problem is handled is often haphazard.
