              >Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. </b
            >Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first
            appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August
            1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured
            in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is
            the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and
            Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker
            died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the
            struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many
            supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and
            Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and
            the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin,
            and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities
            from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to
            surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with
            his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter"
            devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design. When
            Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero
            comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the
            protagonist.
