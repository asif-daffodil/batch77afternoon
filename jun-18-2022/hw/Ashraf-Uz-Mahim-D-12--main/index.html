          The Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence was broadcast from
          Chittagong by members of the Mukti Bahini—the national liberation army
          formed by Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians. The East
          Bengal Regiment and the East Pakistan Rifles played a crucial role in
          the resistance. Led by General M. A. G. Osmani and eleven sector
          commanders, the Bangladesh Forces waged a mass guerrilla war against
          the Pakistani military. They liberated numerous towns and cities in
          the initial months of the conflict. The Pakistan Army regained
          momentum in the monsoon. Bengali guerrillas carried out widespread
          sabotage, including Operation Jackpot against the Pakistan Navy. The
          nascent Bangladesh Air Force flew sorties against Pakistani military
          bases.

          The celebration of Victory Day has been taking place since 1972. The
          Bangladesh Liberation War became a topic of great importance in
          cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the
          arts in Bangladesh. The ritual of the celebration gradually obtained a
          distinctive character with a number of similar elements: Military
          Parade by the Bangladesh Armed Forces at the National Parade Ground,
          ceremonial meetings, speeches, lectures, receptions and fireworks
          displays.[13] Victory Day in Bangladesh is a joyous celebration in
          which popular culture plays a great role.[14] The main streets are
          decorated with national flags. Different political parties and
          socioeconomic organisations undertake programs to mark the day in a
          befitting manner.

          Chinese military action grew increasingly aggressive after India
          rejected proposed Chinese diplomatic settlements throughout 1960–1962,
          with China re-commencing previously-banned "forward patrols" in Ladakh
          from 30 April 1962.[16][17] In the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis,
          China abandoned all attempts of peaceful resolution on 20 October
          1962, invading disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometres (2,004
          mi) long Himalayan border in Ladakh and across the McMahon Line.[18]
          Chinese troops pushed back Indian forces in both theatres, capturing
          Rezang La in Chushul in the western theatre, as well as Tawang in the
          eastern theatre. The war ended when China declared a ceasefire on 20
          November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its
          claimed "Line of Actual Control".

          In October 2002, Congress granted President Bush the power to decide
          whether to launch any military attack in Iraq.[64] The Iraq War began
          on 20 March 2003,[65] when the US, joined by the UK, Australia, and
          Poland, launched a "shock and awe" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were
          quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the country. The
          invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam
          Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that
          same year and executed three years later. The power vacuum following
          Saddam's demise and mismanagement by the Coalition Provisional
          Authority led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis, as
          well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces. The United
          States responded with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007.

        In the speech, Bangabandhu informally declared independence of
        Bangladesh, proclaiming: "The struggle this time, is a struggle for our
        liberty. The struggle this time, is a struggle for our independence." He
        announced a civil disobedience movement in the province, calling for
        "every house to turn into a fortress"

            World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of
            the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster
            international co-operation and prevent future conflicts,[1] with the
            victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United
            Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the permanent members of its
            Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as
            rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly
            half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the
            influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation
            of Africa and Asia.

            damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and
            economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to
            forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense
            of common identity.
